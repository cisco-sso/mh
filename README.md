mh simplifies multi-chart Helm workflows by rendering ephemeral Helm
chart override files based on templates populated with values from mh
YAML config files.

In other words: We heard you like templates, so we templated your Helm value
overrides.

Usage:
  mh [command]

Available Commands:
  apply       Apply apps
  destroy     Destroy apps
  help        Help about any command
  license     Print license information.
  simulate    Simulate apps
  status      Get status of apps
  version     Print version information.

Flags:
  -c, --config string     config file (you can instead set MH_CONFIG)
  -h, --help              help for mh
  -j, --json              set logging to JSON format

Use "mh [command] --help" for more information about a command.

## Getting Started

### Install mh.

(NOTE: Build below currently requires a working golang dev environment.)

(Simplified install coming soon!)

```
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep   # https://github.com/golang/dep
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/cisco-sso
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cisco-sso
git clone git@github.com:cisco-sso/mh.git
cd mh
dep ensure
go build -o /tmp/mh main.go
sudo cp /tmp/mh /usr/local/bin
rm -f /tmp/mh
```

### Select a kubectl context.

(In general, this is when you "choose a Kubernetes cluster" to manage.)

```
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context minikube
```

### Select a mh config.

(There's usally one mh config per kubetl context, but we've left it open
ended so that multple teams can more easily work together on one cluster.)

```
export MH_CONFIG="/path/to/clusters/minikube/mh/main.yaml"
```

### Get status of everything at context "minkube" managed by this mh config.

(This basically runs `helm status` for each app you target.)

```
mh status
# ^ get status for all apps in `main.yaml`

mh status wordpress
# ^ get status for just these app(s)
```

### Simulate app upgrades (or simulate install of apps, as needed).

(For each app you target, simulate runs a Helm upgrade/install
with debug and dry-run modes enabled.)

```
mh simulate
# ^ simulate install/upgrade for all apps in `main.yaml`

mh simulate --printRendered
# ^ simulate install/upgrade for all apps in `main.yaml`
#   (verbosely printing app template renderings)

mh simulate wordpress
# ^ simulate install/upgrade just these app(s),
#   even if they are not in `main.yaml`
```

### Apply app upgrades (or install apps, as needed).

(For each app you target, apply runs a Helm upgrade/install).

```
mh apply
# ^ apply install/upgrade for all apps in `main.yaml`

mh apply --printRendered
# ^ apply install/upgrade for all apps in `main.yaml`
#   (verbosely printing app template renderings)

mh apply wordpress
# ^ apply install/upgrade just these app(s),
#   even if they are not in `main.yaml`
```

### Destroy apps (if they are known to Helm).

(For each app you target, apply runs a Helm delete without purge).

```
mh destroy
# ^ destroy all apps in `main.yaml`

mh destroy wordpress
# ^ destroy just these app(s),
#   even if they are not in `main.yaml`
```

### Log to JSON!

```
mh status foo --json 2>&1 | jq --slurp
```
